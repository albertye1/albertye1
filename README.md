Hi! I'm Albert, freshman at UC Berkeley and algo/DS fan.

## Previous Work
I've done competitive programming throughout high school. The repository of problems I've worked on throughout the years is on my old account: https://github.com/xyzyzl/hard-cp

Also, I've helped create a [learning portal](https://github.com/wlmchen/learn.theyei) for AP Microeconomics and AP Macroeconomics as part of the Youth Economics Initiative (YEI).

## Currently
A (current) compilation of lecture notes can be found @ https://github.com/albertye1/notes.

Working on a project to encode, decode, and remove messages from a PNG file in https://github.com/albertye1/thigh-highs-2. So named because it's in Rust.
