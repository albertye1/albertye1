Hi! I'm Albert, a UC Berkeley CS alum. You can view my portfolio at https://albie.cat.

## Cool Repos
I built [a simple clone](https://github.com/albertye1/wechat_chigua) of Suika game. I've exported the game to WebAssembly, and the game can be played [here](https://suika.aly.sh).

In freshman year, I worked with another member of UPE to create [an encoder](https://github.com/albertye1/stegosaurus) for PNG files. We then worked together on projects for CS 164, which I taught fall 2024.

I've done competitive programming throughout high school, and now I teach for [X-Camp](https://x-camp.academy) and write problems for [CALICO](https://calico.cs.berkeley.edu). Questions I wrote include [rescueteam](https://calicojudge.com/team/problems/515/statement).

Also, I've helped create a [learning portal](https://github.com/wlmchen/learn.theyei) for AP Microeconomics and AP Macroeconomics as part of the Youth Economics Initiative (YEI).

i use [nixos](https://github.com/albertye1/nix-configs) btw (still a work in progress)
