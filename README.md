Hi! I'm Albert, a junior at UC Berkeley majoring in computer science. You can view my portfolio at https://aly.sh.

## Previous Work
I've done competitive programming throughout high school. The repository of problems I've worked on throughout the years is on my old account: https://github.com/xyzyzl/compprog.

Also, I've helped create a [learning portal](https://github.com/wlmchen/learn.theyei) for AP Microeconomics and AP Macroeconomics as part of the Youth Economics Initiative (YEI).

## Currently
A (current) compilation of lecture notes can be found @ https://github.com/albertye1/notes.
